List of small (and maybe difficult) changes to polish the game
  1) Allow player and companion to move through each other
  2) Rework the jump boost to be the following
    a) when player is at the companions upper body, player can press jump to initate jump boost animation
    b) play the jump boost animation
    c) when done, the player gets launched upwards at the greater velocity
  3) More environmental stuff (for example, hold down button and moving platform). This will justify having a stay command.
  4) Enemies with projectiles (Annoying enemy location will require having to press hunt)
  5) Upgrade the companion AI
    a) Create path-finding algorithm
    b) Optionally, create nav-mesh generator
    c) Enemy detection now requires a separate camera with camera follow script for the companion.
    d) Movement uses path-finding instead of checking position without taking into consideration of terrain
  6) Restart button
  7) Add exit gate sprite and animation
